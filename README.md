## ⚛️ Why Vanilla JS?

Despite having **hands-on experience with ReactJs**, I chose to build **UrDashboard** in **vanilla JavaScript** to ensure lightweight performance and avoid unnecessary dependencies for a Chrome extension.

This project was structured with **React-like principles** in mind:

* **Component-Driven Logic**: Features like Weather, Quote, Word, and To-Do are encapsulated and independently managed
* **State Management Thinking**: UI interactions mimic `useState` and `useEffect` behavior
* **Scalability**: The structure can easily be refactored into React or integrated with Payload CMS
